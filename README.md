Final practice project for my subject for Multimedia programming for mobile devices.

Will include the following:
1. Activities.
2. Fragments (at least 3).
3. Use of services that require permissions such as camera, gps, sending or receiving SMS, calendar or accelerometer.
4. Navigation between activities/fragments. 
5. Toolbar with menus. 
6. Sidebar/navigationView. 
7. Definition of RecyclerView and adapters for element listings. 
8. Alternative layout depending on device/device configuration. 
9. Definition of viewModel for the logic of the graphical part by correctly selecting the scope.
10. Use of LiveData so that the application is reactive.
11. Storing information in database using ROOM.
